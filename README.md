# Customer Segments
A wholesale distributor recently tested a change to their delivery method for some customers, by moving from a morning delivery service five days a week to a cheaper evening delivery service three days a week. Initial testing did not discover any significant unsatisfactory results, so they implemented the cheaper option for all customers. Almost immediately, the distributor began getting complaints about the delivery service change and customers were canceling deliveries, losing the distributor more money than what was being saved. This analysis tries to find what types of customers the distributor has to help them make better, more informed business decisions in the future.

This analyis applies unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. EDA is conducted by selecting a small subset to sample and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. Afterwards, data is preprocessed by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. Next, PCA transformations were applied to the data to implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. The segmentation found with an additional labeling is analyzed to look for way that this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.
